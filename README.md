## **5. Advanced Version Control**

### **Step 1: Viewing Commit History**

See all the commits in your project.

```bash
git log
```

*Press `q` to exit the log view.*

### **Step 2: Checking Differences Between Commits**

View changes between commits or working directory.

```bash
git diff
```

*To see differences between branches:*
```bash
git diff branch1 branch2
```

### **Step 3: Creating Tags (For Releases)**

Tags mark specific points in your project's history, such as releases.

1. **Create a Tag:**
   ```bash
   git tag -a v1.0 -m "First release"
   ```
2. **Push Tag to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git push origin v1.0
   ```

*Now, `v1.0` appears in your repository’s tags on GitHub.*

## **6. Using `.gitignore`**

### **Step 1: Creating a `.gitignore` File**

`.gitignore` specifies files or directories that Git should ignore.

1. **Create the File:**
   ```bash
   touch .gitignore
   ```
2. **Edit the File:**
   Open `.gitignore` in your text editor and add patterns for files to ignore. For example:
   ```
   __pycache__/
   *.pyc
   venv/
   ```

### **Step 2: Applying `.gitignore`**

After adding patterns, stage and commit the `.gitignore` file:

```bash
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Add .gitignore to exclude unnecessary files"
git push origin main
```

## **7. Contributing to Open Source**

### **Step 1: Finding Open Source Projects**

1. **Explore GitHub:**
   - Use GitHub’s search or browse popular repositories.
2. **Look for Labels:**
   - Search for labels like `good-first-issue`, `help-wanted`, or `beginner-friendly`.
3. **Choose a Project:** Select a project that interests you and matches your skill level.

### **Step 2: Understanding Contribution Guidelines**

1. **Read `CONTRIBUTING.md`:**
   - Most open-source projects have this file outlining how to contribute.
2. **Follow Coding Standards:**
   - Adhere to the project’s coding style and guidelines.
3. **Communicate:**
   - Engage with maintainers via issues or discussions if you have questions.

   - Clearly describe what changes you made and why.
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Refactor authentication module for better security"
   ```
2. **Use Branches Effectively:**
   - Create separate branches for new features or bug fixes.
3. **Keep Repositories Organized:**
   - Use meaningful folder structures and file names.
4. **Maintain a Detailed `README.md`:**
   - Explain the project’s purpose, how to set it up, and how to contribute.
5. **Regularly Pull Updates:**
   - Keep your local repository updated with changes from the remote repository.
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```
6. **Review Code Before Merging:**
   - Always review changes in pull requests before merging to ensure quality.

## **9. Advanced Topics**

### **1. Rebasing**

Rebasing allows you to integrate changes from one branch into another more cleanly.

```bash
git checkout feature-branch
git rebase main
```

*This moves your `feature-branch` to start from the latest commit on `main`.*

### **2. Squashing Commits**

Combine multiple commits into a single commit to simplify history.

1. **Interactive Rebase:**
   ```bash
   git rebase -i HEAD~n
   ```
   *Replace `n` with the number of commits you want to squash.*
2. **Mark Commits to Squash:**
   - In the editor, change `pick` to `squash` (or `s`) for commits you want to combine.
3. **Save and Exit:**
   - Git will prompt you to edit the commit message.

### **3. Resolving Merge Conflicts**

Conflicts occur when changes from different branches clash.

1. **Identify Conflicts:**
   ```bash
   git status
   ```
2. **Edit Conflicted Files:**
   - Look for conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`) and resolve manually.
3. **Stage Resolved Files:**
   ```bash
   git add conflicted-file.py
   ```
4. **Continue Merge/Rebase:**
   ```bash
   git commit
   ```
   *Or if rebasing:*
   ```bash
   git rebase --continue
   ```

### **4. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) with GitHub Actions**

Automate testing and deployment workflows.

1. **Create Workflow File:**
   - In your repository, navigate to `.github/workflows/` and create a `.yml` file.
2. **Define Workflow:**
   - Specify triggers (e.g., on push or pull request) and jobs (e.g., running tests).
3. **Example Workflow:**
   ```yaml
   name: CI

   on: [push, pull_request]

   jobs:
     build:

       runs-on: ubuntu-latest

       steps:
       - uses: actions/checkout@v2
       - name: Set up Python
         uses: actions/setup-python@v2
         with:
           python-version: '3.x'
       - name: Install dependencies
         run: |
           pip install -r requirements.txt
       - name: Run tests
         run: |
           pytest
   ```

*This workflow runs tests automatically on every push or pull request.*
